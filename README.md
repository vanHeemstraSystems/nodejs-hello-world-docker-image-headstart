# NodeJS "Hello World" Docker Image  - Headstart

Based on "A simple docker setup for hello world nodejs application" at https://medium.com/@sssanjaya/a-simple-docker-setup-for-simple-hello-world-nodejs-application-bcf79bb608a0

## STEP 1: Creating simple nodejs hello world app

Assuming that nodejs installed on your system.
See https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/how-to-install-nodejs-npm-on-centos-7

### Installation
create new directory and initialize npm:

````javascript
mkdir nodejs-hello
cd nodejs-hello
npm init
````

confirm default values with enter.

npm will create a package.json which holds the dependencies of our app and following code will add express framework as a dependency.

````javascript
npm install express --save
````

### Creating index.js with simple http server that will serve on port 8080

````javascript
//now it load express module with `require` directive
var express = require('express')
var app = express()
//Define request response in root URL (/) and response with text Hello World!
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})
//Launch listening server on port 8080 and consoles the log.
app.listen(8080, function () {
  console.log('app listening on port 8080!')
})
````

### Running this app

````javascript
node index.js
````

This will show the log as that app is listening on port 8080. You can stop it with CTRL + C. And check out http://localhost:8080/ in your browser, it will respond with Hello World!. Alternatively if you live in a terminal, you can do:

````javascript
curl http://localhost:8080/
````

which will return the same Hello World! in the terminal.

## STEP 2: dockerize our app

Lets assume docker is installed

### Create Dockerfile to root directory

````javascript
## it uses node js image alpine version from image registries.
FROM node:8.16.1-alpine
## it sets directory in the container to /app to store files and launch our app.
WORKDIR /app
## it copies the app to /app directory with dependencies.
COPY package.json /app
RUN npm install
COPY . /app
## it commands to run our app which is index.js.
CMD node index.js
##  it exposes the port where our app is running that is port 8080.
EXPOSE 8080
````

### To build this image

````javascript
docker build -t web .
````
